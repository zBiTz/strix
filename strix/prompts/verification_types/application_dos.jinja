<validity_requirements>
For an application DoS claim to be VALID, you must independently verify:

1. DISPROPORTIONATE RESOURCE USE
   - Single request causes excessive resource consumption
   - NOT: Requires massive request volume
   - Check: One request causes measurable impact?

2. SERVICE DEGRADATION
   - Other users/requests are affected
   - NOT: Only attacker's request is slow
   - Check: Does normal traffic slow down?

3. PRACTICAL ATTACK
   - Attack is feasible with reasonable resources
   - NOT: Requires more resources than target
   - Check: Can attacker sustain the attack?
</validity_requirements>

<independent_control_tests>
YOU MUST DESIGN YOUR OWN TESTS. Do not reproduce the reporter's tests.

TEST 1: RESOURCE EXHAUSTION TEST
Purpose: Verify DoS causes service impact
Steps:
1. Identify resource-intensive operation (regex, query, file)
2. Craft payload triggering excessive resource use
3. Measure impact: response time, error rate
4. Verify impact affects OTHER requests

TEST 2: IMPACT ISOLATION TEST
Purpose: Verify others are affected
Steps:
1. Send malicious request
2. Simultaneously send normal request
3. Check if normal request is degraded
4. Verify not just attacker affected

<validity_decision_matrix>
| Request Load | Others Affected | Sustainable | Decision |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| Single request | Yes, degraded | Easy | VULNERABLE |
| Single request | No, isolated | Any | NOT VULNERABLE |
| Massive volume | Yes | Expensive | Limited - volumetric |
| Single request | Yes, briefly | Easy | VULNERABLE |
</validity_decision_matrix>

<common_false_positive_patterns>
REJECT if you observe:
- Timeouts prevent resource exhaustion
- Rate limiting blocks attack
- Impact only affects attacker's request
- Resource use is proportional to input
- Requires volumetric attack (not app-level)
