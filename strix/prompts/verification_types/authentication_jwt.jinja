<validity_requirements>
For an authentication/JWT claim to be VALID, you must independently verify:

1. BYPASS OR FORGERY POSSIBLE
   - Authentication can be bypassed or tokens forged
   - NOT: Just decoding JWT (that's by design)
   - Check: Can you access protected resources without valid credentials?

2. PROTECTED RESOURCE ACCESS
   - Bypass grants access to actually protected resources
   - NOT: Public resources accessible anyway
   - Check: Does bypass give you access normal auth would deny?

3. SERVER-SIDE VALIDATION FAILURE
   - Server accepts invalid/forged tokens
   - NOT: Client-side checks bypassed (irrelevant)
   - Check: Does server process the forged token?
</validity_requirements>

<independent_control_tests>
YOU MUST DESIGN YOUR OWN TESTS. Do not reproduce the reporter's tests.

TEST 1: BYPASS VERIFICATION
Purpose: Verify auth can be bypassed
Steps:
1. Identify auth mechanism (JWT, session, API key)
2. Test bypass techniques:
   - JWT: alg=none, HS256 with known key, expired tokens
   - Session: Null session, predictable ID
3. Verify bypassed auth grants protected access

TEST 2: TOKEN MANIPULATION TEST
Purpose: For JWT - verify manipulation accepted
Steps:
1. Decode JWT and modify claims (role, user_id)
2. Test algorithm attacks:
   - Change RS256 to HS256, sign with public key
   - Set alg=none, remove signature
3. Verify modified token accepted with elevated access

<validity_decision_matrix>
| Token Modification | Server Response | Access Level | Decision |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| alg=none | Accepted | Admin/elevated | VULNERABLE |
| Modified claims | Signature error | N/A | NOT VULNERABLE |
| Expired token | Accepted | Normal | VULNERABLE |
| Invalid signature | Rejected | N/A | NOT VULNERABLE |
</validity_decision_matrix>

<common_false_positive_patterns>
REJECT if you observe:
- Modified tokens rejected with signature error
- Expired tokens correctly rejected
- Algorithm confusion not possible (strict validation)
- None algorithm explicitly rejected
- Accessing resources that are public anyway
