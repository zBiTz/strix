<broken_function_level_authorization_verification>
<validity_requirements>
For a BFLA claim to be VALID, you must independently verify:

1. PRIVILEGED FUNCTION
   - Function requires elevated privileges
   - NOT: Public function accessible to all
   - Check: Is this an admin/staff function?

2. UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS
   - Low-privilege user can access the function
   - NOT: User has legitimate access
   - Check: Does a regular user get in?

3. FUNCTION EXECUTES
   - The function actually runs, not just endpoint discovered
   - NOT: Just 200 OK without action
   - Check: Does the admin action complete?
</validity_requirements>

<independent_control_tests>
YOU MUST DESIGN YOUR OWN TESTS. Do not reproduce the reporter's tests.

TEST 1: PRIVILEGE BOUNDARY TEST
Purpose: Verify function crosses privilege boundary
Steps:
1. Identify admin/privileged endpoint
2. Access with low-privilege credentials
3. Verify function executes
4. Confirm function should require higher privileges

TEST 2: FUNCTION EXECUTION VERIFICATION
Purpose: Verify action completes
Steps:
1. Trigger admin function as regular user
2. Check for actual state change
3. Verify not just endpoint access but action completion

<validity_decision_matrix>
| User Privilege | Function Access | Execution | Decision |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| Low/None | Admin function | Executes | VULNERABLE |
| Low/None | Admin function | Blocked | NOT VULNERABLE |
| Admin | Admin function | Executes | Working as designed |
| Low/None | Public function | Executes | NOT VULNERABLE (public) |
</validity_decision_matrix>

<common_false_positive_patterns>
REJECT if you observe:
- Function properly requires authentication
- Endpoint discovered but function blocked
- User has legitimate access to function
- Admin function correctly restricted
- Only endpoint discovery without execution
