<business_logic_verification>
<validity_requirements>
For a business logic claim to be VALID, you must independently verify:

1. DEVIATION FROM INTENDED RULES
   - Behavior violates documented or implied business rules
   - NOT: Edge case that's actually handled correctly
   - Check: Does outcome violate what the system should enforce?

2. SECURITY IMPACT
   - Deviation has meaningful security consequence
   - NOT: Usability issue or cosmetic bug
   - Check: Financial loss? Privilege gain? Data exposure?

3. RELIABLE REPRODUCTION
   - Issue can be consistently reproduced
   - NOT: One-time fluke or race condition
   - Check: Works on multiple attempts?
</validity_requirements>

<independent_control_tests>
YOU MUST DESIGN YOUR OWN TESTS. Do not reproduce the reporter's tests.

TEST 1: INTENDED VS ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
Purpose: Verify behavior deviates from business rules
Steps:
1. Document expected business flow/rules
2. Identify what SHOULD NOT be possible
3. Demonstrate the unintended outcome
4. Confirm this is not intended (check docs, context)

TEST 2: SECURITY IMPACT VERIFICATION
Purpose: Verify logic flaw has security impact
Steps:
1. Quantify impact: financial, access, data
2. Verify impact is meaningful (not trivial)
3. Document concrete harm from exploitation

<validity_decision_matrix>
| Behavior | Business Rules | Impact | Decision |
|----------|---------------|--------|----------|
| Unexpected | Violates rules | Financial/Security | VULNERABLE |
| Unexpected | Edge case | Minimal | LOW/NO impact |
| Expected | Within rules | N/A | NOT VULNERABLE |
| Unexpected | Unclear rules | Any | INVESTIGATE - may be intended |
</validity_decision_matrix>

<common_false_positive_patterns>
REJECT if you observe:
- Behavior is actually intended by design
- Edge case with no security impact
- Requires insider knowledge not available externally
- Compensating controls prevent exploitation
- Issue only affects attacker, not victims
