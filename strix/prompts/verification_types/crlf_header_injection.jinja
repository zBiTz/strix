<crlf_header_injection_verification>
<validity_requirements>
For a CRLF/header injection claim to be VALID, you must independently verify:

1. CRLF PROCESSED
   - CRLF sequences are interpreted, not filtered
   - NOT: %0d%0a appearing literally in response
   - Check: Does response have actual newline/header?

2. HEADER INJECTION
   - Can inject arbitrary headers into response
   - NOT: Just reflection without processing
   - Check: Does injected header appear as HTTP header?

3. SECURITY IMPACT
   - Injection affects response behavior
   - NOT: Cosmetic header with no effect
   - Check: Can you set cookies? Location? Content-Type?
</validity_requirements>

<independent_control_tests>
YOU MUST DESIGN YOUR OWN TESTS. Do not reproduce the reporter's tests.

TEST 1: HEADER INJECTION TEST
Purpose: Verify custom headers can be injected
Steps:
1. Inject CRLF: %0d%0aX-Injected: true
2. Check response headers for X-Injected
3. Verify header is processed, not reflected in body
4. Test Set-Cookie injection for impact

TEST 2: RESPONSE SPLITTING TEST
Purpose: Verify HTTP response splitting
Steps:
1. Inject CRLF + complete HTTP response
2. Check if browser parses injected response
3. Verify content after CRLF+CRLF is body

<validity_decision_matrix>
| CRLF Handling | Header Injection | Impact | Decision |
|---------------|------------------|--------|----------|
| Interpreted | Yes, custom headers | Security headers | VULNERABLE |
| Filtered/encoded | No | N/A | NOT VULNERABLE |
| Interpreted | Body only | Limited | LIMITED impact |
| Interpreted | Log files only | None | LOW impact |
</validity_decision_matrix>

<common_false_positive_patterns>
REJECT if you observe:
- CRLF sequences URL-encoded in output
- Newlines stripped or rejected
- Headers reflected but not in HTTP headers
- Only affects log files, not responses
- Modern framework auto-encodes
