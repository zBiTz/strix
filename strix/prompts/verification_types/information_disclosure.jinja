<information_disclosure_verification>
<validity_requirements>
For an information disclosure claim to be VALID, you must independently verify:

1. SENSITIVE INFORMATION
   - Disclosed data is actually sensitive
   - NOT: Version numbers or public info
   - Check: Credentials? PII? Source code? Internal paths?

2. UNINTENDED EXPOSURE
   - Information should not be publicly accessible
   - NOT: Intentionally public data
   - Check: Would this data normally require auth?

3. ACTIONABLE IMPACT
   - Disclosure enables further attacks or causes harm
   - NOT: Theoretical risk only
   - Check: Can leaked info be used for attacks?
</validity_requirements>

<independent_control_tests>
YOU MUST DESIGN YOUR OWN TESTS. Do not reproduce the reporter's tests.

TEST 1: SENSITIVITY VERIFICATION
Purpose: Verify information is sensitive
Steps:
1. Classify the information type
2. Assess: credentials, PII, internal paths, source code?
3. Determine if info enables further attacks

TEST 2: ACCESS CONTROL TEST
Purpose: Verify information should be restricted
Steps:
1. Check if intentionally public (API docs, public profiles)
2. Compare authenticated vs unauthenticated access
3. Review application purpose - is disclosure expected?

<validity_decision_matrix>
| Information Type | Intended Public | Enables Attacks | Decision |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Credentials | No | Yes | VULNERABLE |
| PII | No | Possible | VULNERABLE |
| Version numbers | Usually | Rarely | LOW/NO impact |
| Error messages | Sometimes | Maybe | CONTEXT dependent |
| Source code | No | Yes | VULNERABLE |
</validity_decision_matrix>

<common_false_positive_patterns>
REJECT if you observe:
- Publicly intended information
- Version numbers or generic headers
- Debug info that doesn't enable attacks
- Error messages without sensitive data
- Information available through other channels
