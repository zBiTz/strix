<validity_requirements>
For an insecure file upload claim to be VALID, you must independently verify:

1. EXECUTABLE FILE UPLOADED
   - Server-side executable file can be uploaded
   - NOT: Just any file upload (that's a feature)
   - Check: .php, .jsp, .aspx with code content?

2. FILE ACCESSIBLE VIA URL
   - Uploaded file is accessible via web request
   - NOT: File stored but not accessible
   - Check: Can you request the uploaded file?

3. CODE EXECUTION
   - Server executes the uploaded code
   - NOT: File served as static content
   - Check: Does PHP/JSP/ASPX execute, not download?
</validity_requirements>

<independent_control_tests>
YOU MUST DESIGN YOUR OWN TESTS. Do not reproduce the reporter's tests.

TEST 1: EXECUTION VERIFICATION
Purpose: Verify uploaded file executes
Steps:
1. Upload file with executable extension (.php, .jsp)
2. Content: <?php echo "EXECUTED"; ?>
3. Request the uploaded file URL
4. Check response: "EXECUTED" = code ran, PHP source = static

TEST 2: CONTENT TYPE BYPASS
Purpose: Verify restrictions are bypassable
Steps:
1. Test extension manipulation: .php.jpg, .pHp, .php%00.jpg
2. Test content type mismatch: image/jpeg with PHP content
3. Verify bypass results in executable file

| File Uploaded | File Accessible | Execution | Decision |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| Executable ext | Via URL | Code executes | VULNERABLE |
| Executable ext | Via URL | Served static | NOT VULNERABLE |
| Executable ext | Not accessible | N/A | NOT VULNERABLE |
| Safe ext only | N/A | N/A | NOT VULNERABLE |
</validity_decision_matrix>

<common_false_positive_patterns>
REJECT if you observe:
- Files served as static/binary content
- Files stored with sanitized extensions
- Execution prevented by server config
- Files stored outside web root
- Upload blocked by extension filter
