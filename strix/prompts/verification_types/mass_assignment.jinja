<validity_requirements>
For a mass assignment claim to be VALID, you must independently verify:

1. RESTRICTED PROPERTY MODIFIED
   - Can set properties that should be protected
   - NOT: Setting properties you're allowed to modify
   - Check: role, isAdmin, verified, balance, etc.?

2. CHANGE PERSISTS
   - Modified property is saved to database
   - NOT: Just accepted in request but ignored
   - Check: Subsequent requests show the change?

3. SECURITY IMPACT
   - Modified property affects security
   - NOT: Cosmetic or non-security property
   - Check: Privilege escalation? Balance change?
</validity_requirements>

<independent_control_tests>
YOU MUST DESIGN YOUR OWN TESTS. Do not reproduce the reporter's tests.

TEST 1: PROPERTY INJECTION TEST
Purpose: Verify restricted properties can be set
Steps:
1. Identify protected properties (role, isAdmin)
2. Add property to request: {"name": "test", "isAdmin": true}
3. Check if property was set on server
4. Verify change persists in subsequent requests

TEST 2: IMPACT VERIFICATION
Purpose: Verify property change has security impact
Steps:
1. Before: Verify user is not admin
2. Inject: isAdmin: true
3. After: Verify admin access granted

<validity_decision_matrix>
| Property Type | Server Accepts | Persists | Impact | Decision |
|--------------|----------------|----------|--------|----------|
| Security (role) | Yes | Yes | Privilege | VULNERABLE |
| Security (role) | Ignored | No | N/A | NOT VULNERABLE |
| Non-security | Yes | Yes | None | LOW/NO impact |
| Any | Error | No | N/A | NOT VULNERABLE |
</validity_decision_matrix>

<common_false_positive_patterns>
REJECT if you observe:
- Property ignored by server
- Allowlist prevents restricted properties
- Property set but no security impact
- Read-only fields unaffected
- Validation rejects unexpected fields
