<race_conditions_verification>
<validity_requirements>
For a race condition claim to be VALID, you must independently verify:

1. EXPLOITABLE TIMING WINDOW
   - Race condition can be practically exploited
   - NOT: Theoretical TOCTOU without practical exploitation
   - Check: Can parallel requests achieve the race?

2. MEANINGFUL IMPACT
   - Race leads to security-relevant outcome
   - NOT: Transient state with no lasting effect
   - Check: Double spend? Auth bypass? Privilege escalation?

3. REPRODUCIBILITY
   - Race can be reliably triggered
   - NOT: One-time occurrence
   - Check: Works consistently across multiple attempts?
</validity_requirements>

<independent_control_tests>
YOU MUST DESIGN YOUR OWN TESTS. Do not reproduce the reporter's tests.

TEST 1: TIMING EXPLOITATION TEST
Purpose: Verify race condition is exploitable
Steps:
1. Identify the TOCTOU window
2. Send 10+ parallel requests within timing window
3. Check for race success: duplicate transactions, balance errors
4. Repeat multiple times to confirm reproducibility

TEST 2: IMPACT VERIFICATION
Purpose: Verify race has meaningful impact
Steps:
1. Document what the race achieves
2. Quantify impact: financial, privilege, data
3. Verify impact persists (not auto-corrected)

<validity_decision_matrix>
| Race Success | Impact Persists | Reproducible | Decision |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| Yes | Yes | Consistent | VULNERABLE |
| Yes | Auto-corrected | Any | LIMITED impact |
| No | N/A | Multiple attempts | NOT VULNERABLE |
| Yes | Yes | Once only | INVESTIGATE |
</validity_decision_matrix>

<common_false_positive_patterns>
REJECT if you observe:
- Database transactions prevent race
- Atomic operations in use
- Effects auto-corrected by reconciliation
- Theoretical race without practical exploitation
- Race only possible with localhost timing
</common_false_positive_patterns>
