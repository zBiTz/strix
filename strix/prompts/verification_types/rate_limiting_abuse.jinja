<rate_limiting_abuse_verification>
<validity_requirements>
For a rate limiting abuse claim to be VALID, you must independently verify:

1. LIMIT BYPASS POSSIBLE
   - Rate limit can be circumvented
   - NOT: Limit properly enforced
   - Check: Can you sustain high request rate?

2. MEANINGFUL ATTACK ENABLED
   - Bypass enables real attack (brute force, scraping)
   - NOT: Just faster API access
   - Check: Can you brute force passwords?

3. PRACTICAL EXPLOITATION
   - Attack is feasible with reasonable resources
   - NOT: Requires massive infrastructure
   - Check: Works from single IP with simple bypass?
</validity_requirements>

<independent_control_tests>
YOU MUST DESIGN YOUR OWN TESTS. Do not reproduce the reporter's tests.

TEST 1: LIMIT BYPASS TEST
Purpose: Verify rate limit can be bypassed
Steps:
1. Identify rate-limited endpoint (login, API)
2. Test bypass: different IPs, headers, user agents
3. Check if limit resets with bypass technique
4. Verify sustained high rate possible

TEST 2: ATTACK VIABILITY TEST
Purpose: Verify bypass enables meaningful attack
Steps:
1. Identify sensitive operation (login, OTP)
2. Test brute force with bypass
3. Verify attack is practical

<validity_decision_matrix>
| Bypass Works | Attack Possible | Practical | Decision |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| Yes | Brute force login | Simple bypass | VULNERABLE |
| Yes | Scraping only | Any | LIMITED impact |
| No | N/A | N/A | NOT VULNERABLE |
| Yes | Theoretical | Massive resources | LOW impact |
</validity_decision_matrix>

<common_false_positive_patterns>
REJECT if you observe:
- Rate limit properly enforced
- Bypass requires unrealistic resources
- No sensitive operation to brute force
- Account lockout prevents brute force
- Limit is generous by design
