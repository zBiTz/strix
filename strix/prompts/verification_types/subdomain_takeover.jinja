<subdomain_takeover_verification>
<validity_requirements>
For a subdomain takeover claim to be VALID, you must independently verify:

1. DANGLING DNS RECORD
   - DNS points to unclaimed/claimable resource
   - NOT: Working resource or unresolvable domain
   - Check: CNAME/A to unclaimed S3, Heroku, Azure, etc.?

2. RESOURCE CLAIMABLE
   - The target resource can be claimed by attacker
   - NOT: Resource owned by organization or uncreatable
   - Check: Can you claim the bucket/app/blob?

3. CONTENT CONTROL
   - Your content is served on the subdomain
   - NOT: Just DNS pointing to error page
   - Check: Can you serve arbitrary content?
</validity_requirements>

<independent_control_tests>
YOU MUST DESIGN YOUR OWN TESTS. Do not reproduce the reporter's tests.

TEST 1: DNS CLAIM VERIFICATION
Purpose: Verify subdomain can be claimed
Steps:
1. Identify dangling CNAME/A record
2. Check if target service allows claiming
3. Claim the resource (S3 bucket, Heroku app)
4. Verify your content is served on subdomain

TEST 2: CONTROL DEMONSTRATION
Purpose: Verify full control of content
Steps:
1. Serve custom HTML on the subdomain
2. Verify accessible via subdomain URL
3. Demonstrate control (custom content, cookies)

<validity_decision_matrix>
| DNS Record | Resource Status | Content Control | Decision |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Dangling CNAME | Claimable | Full control | VULNERABLE |
| Dangling CNAME | Already owned | None | NOT VULNERABLE |
| Valid CNAME | Working resource | N/A | NOT VULNERABLE |
| Dangling CNAME | Unclaimable service | None | NOT VULNERABLE |
</validity_decision_matrix>

<common_false_positive_patterns>
REJECT if you observe:
- Resource already claimed by organization
- DNS properly configured and working
- Service doesn't allow external claiming
- Subdomain not in main domain trust boundary
- Generic error page without content control
