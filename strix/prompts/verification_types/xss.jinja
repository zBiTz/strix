<validity_requirements>
For an XSS claim to be VALID, you must independently verify:

1. SCRIPT EXECUTION (not just reflection)
   - Script actually EXECUTES in browser, not just appears in source
   - NOT: Payload visible in HTML source but encoded or in non-executing context
   - Check: Does alert fire, DOM change, or OAST callback arrive?

2. PROPER CONTEXT
   - Injection is in a context where browsers execute scripts
   - NOT: Inside title, textarea, or properly quoted attributes
   - Check: Is the payload in HTML body, unquoted attribute, or JS context?

3. NO ENCODING
   - Special characters are not HTML-encoded
   - NOT: &lt; &gt; &quot; appearing instead of < > "
   - Check: View response bytes, not just rendered output
</validity_requirements>

<independent_control_tests>
YOU MUST DESIGN YOUR OWN TESTS. Do not reproduce the reporter's tests.

TEST 1: EXECUTION VERIFICATION
Purpose: Verify script EXECUTES, not just reflects
Steps:
1. Inject payload with observable effect: <script>fetch('https://OAST')</script>
2. Load the page in an ACTUAL BROWSER (not just curl)
3. Check for execution evidence:
   - OAST callback received from victim origin
   - DOM changes visible in inspector
   - alert() fires (if using that payload)
4. View source alone is NOT sufficient

TEST 2: ENCODING CHECK
Purpose: Verify output is not properly encoded
Steps:
1. Inject: <script>alert(1)</script>
2. Examine RAW response (curl or Burp)
3. Check character representation:
   - < appearing as < = vulnerable (unencoded)
   - < appearing as &lt; = safe (encoded)
   - " appearing as &quot; = safe (encoded)

TEST 3: CONTEXT VALIDATION
Purpose: Verify injection is in executable context
Steps:
1. Identify WHERE payload appears in response
2. Check context rules:
   - Inside <title>: scripts don't execute
   - Inside <textarea>: scripts don't execute
   - Inside attribute with quotes: need quote break
   - Inside JS string: need string break
3. Verify your payload breaks out and executes

<validity_decision_matrix>
| Payload in Source | Browser Execution | Encoding | Decision |
|------------------|-------------------|----------|----------|
| Yes | Script executes | Unencoded | VULNERABLE |
| Yes | No execution | Unencoded | Check context - may be non-exec |
| Yes | No execution | HTML entities | NOT VULNERABLE - encoded |
| No | N/A | N/A | NOT VULNERABLE - filtered |
| Yes (in attr) | Attribute injection | Unencoded | Check if exploitable attr |
</validity_decision_matrix>

<common_false_positive_patterns>
REJECT if you observe:
- Payload appears in source but doesn't execute
- HTML entities encoding special characters (&lt; &gt;)
- Injection in non-executable contexts (title, textarea, comment)
- CSP blocking script execution (check console errors)
- Reflection in error message without execution
- Self-XSS requiring victim to paste code
