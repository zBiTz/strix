<title>INSECURE DIRECT OBJECT REFERENCE (IDOR)</title>

<critical>Object- and function-level authorization failures (BOLA/IDOR) routinely lead to cross-account data exposure and unauthorized state changes across APIs, web, mobile, and microservices. Treat every object reference as untrusted until proven bound to the caller.</critical>

<scope>
- Horizontal access: access another subject's objects of the same type
- Vertical access: access privileged objects/actions (admin-only, staff-only)
- Cross-tenant access: break isolation boundaries in multi-tenant systems
- Cross-service access: token or context accepted by the wrong service
</scope>

<methodology>
1. Build a Subject × Object × Action matrix (who can do what to which resource).
2. For each resource type, obtain at least two principals: owner and non-owner (plus admin/staff if applicable). Capture at least one valid object ID per principal.
3. Exercise every action (R/W/D/Export) while swapping IDs, tokens, tenants, and channels (web, mobile, API, GraphQL, WebSocket, gRPC).
4. Track consistency: the same rule must hold regardless of transport, content-type, serialization, or gateway.
</methodology>

<discovery_techniques>
<parameter_analysis>
- Object references appear in: paths, query params, JSON bodies, form-data, headers, cookies, JWT claims, GraphQL arguments, WebSocket messages, gRPC messages
- Identifier forms: integers, UUID/ULID/CUID, Snowflake, slugs, composite keys (e.g., {orgId}:{userId}), opaque tokens, base64/hex-encoded blobs
- Relationship references: parentId, ownerId, accountId, tenantId, organization, teamId, projectId, subscriptionId
- Expansion/projection knobs: fields, include, expand, projection, with, select, populate (often bypass authorization in resolvers or serializers)
- Pagination/cursors: page[offset], page[limit], cursor, nextPageToken (often reveal or accept cross-tenant/state)
</parameter_analysis>

<advanced_enumeration>
- Alternate types: {% raw %}{"id":123}{% endraw} vs {% raw %}{"id":"123"}{% endraw}, arrays vs scalars, objects vs scalars, null/empty/0/-1/MAX_INT, scientific notation, overflows, unknown attributes retained by backend
- Duplicate keys/parameter pollution: id=1&id=2, JSON duplicate keys {% raw %}{"id":1,"id":2}{% endraw} (parser precedence differences)
- Case/aliasing: userId vs userid vs USER_ID; alt names like resourceId, targetId, account
- Path traversal-like in virtual file systems: /files/user_123/../../user_456/report.csv
- Directory/list endpoints as seeders: search/list/suggest/export often leak object IDs for secondary exploitation
</advanced_enumeration>
</discovery_techniques>

<high_value_targets>
- Exports/backups/reporting endpoints (CSV/PDF/ZIP)
- Messaging/mailbox/notifications, audit logs, activity feeds
- Billing: invoices, payment methods, transactions, credits
- Healthcare/education records, HR documents, PII/PHI/PCI
- Admin/staff tools, impersonation/session management
- File/object storage keys (S3/GCS signed URLs, share links)
- Background jobs: import/export job IDs, task results
- Multi-tenant resources: organizations, workspaces, projects
</high_value_targets>

<exploitation_techniques>
<horizontal_vertical>
- Swap object IDs between principals using the same token to probe horizontal access; then repeat with lower-privilege tokens to probe vertical access
- Target partial updates (PATCH, JSON Patch/JSON Merge Patch) for silent unauthorized modifications
</horizontal_vertical>

<bulk_and_batch>
- Batch endpoints (bulk update/delete) often validate only the first element; include cross-tenant IDs mid-array
- CSV/JSON imports referencing foreign object IDs (ownerId, orgId) may bypass create-time checks
</bulk_and_batch>

<secondary_idor>
- Use list/search endpoints, notifications, emails, webhooks, and client logs to collect valid IDs, then fetch or mutate those objects directly
- Pagination/cursor manipulation to skip filters and pull other users' pages
</secondary_idor>

<job_task_objects>
- Access job/task IDs from one user to retrieve results for another (export/{jobId}/download, reports/{taskId})
- Cancel/approve someone else's jobs by referencing their task IDs
</job_task_objects>

<file_object_storage>
- Direct object paths or weakly scoped signed URLs; attempt key prefix changes, content-disposition tricks, or stale signatures reused across tenants
- Replace share tokens with tokens from other tenants; try case/URL-encoding variations
</file_object_storage>
</exploitation_techniques>

<advanced_techniques>
<graphql>
- Enforce resolver-level checks: do not rely on a top-level gate. Verify field and edge resolvers bind the resource to the caller on every hop
- Abuse batching/aliases to retrieve multiple users' nodes in one request and compare responses
- Global node patterns (Relay): decode base64 IDs and swap raw IDs; test {% raw %}node(id: "...base64..."){...}{% endraw %}
- Overfetching via fragments on privileged types; verify hidden fields cannot be queried by unprivileged callers
- Example:
{% raw %}
query IDOR {
  me { id }
  u1: user(id: "VXNlcjo0NTY=") { email billing { last4 } }
  u2: node(id: "VXNlcjo0NTc=") { ... on User { email } }
}
{% endraw %}
</graphql>

<microservices_gateways>
- Token confusion: a token scoped for Service A accepted by Service B due to shared JWT verification but missing audience/claims checks
- Trust on headers: reverse proxies or API gateways injecting/trusting headers like X-User-Id, X-Organization-Id; try overriding or removing them
- Context loss: async consumers (queues, workers) re-process requests without re-checking authorization
</microservices_gateways>

<multi_tenant>
- Probe tenant scoping through headers, subdomains, and path params (e.g., X-Tenant-ID, org slug). Try mixing org of token with resource from another org
- Test cross-tenant reports/analytics rollups and admin views which aggregate multiple tenants
</multi_tenant>

<uuid_and_opaque_ids>
- UUID/ULID are not authorization: acquire valid IDs from logs, exports, JS bundles, analytics endpoints, emails, or public activity, then test ownership binding
- Time-based IDs (UUIDv1, ULID) may be guessable within a window; combine with leakage sources for targeted access
</uuid_and_opaque_ids>

<blind_channels>
- Use differential responses (status, size, ETag, timing) to detect existence; error shape often differs for owned vs foreign objects
- HEAD/OPTIONS, conditional requests (If-None-Match/If-Modified-Since) can confirm existence without full content
</blind_channels>
</advanced_techniques>

<bypass_techniques>
<parser_and_transport>
- Content-type switching: application/json ↔ application/x-www-form-urlencoded ↔ multipart/form-data; some paths enforce checks per parser
- Method tunneling: X-HTTP-Method-Override, _method=PATCH; or using GET on endpoints incorrectly accepting state changes
- JSON duplicate keys/array injection to bypass naive validators
</parser_and_transport>

<parameter_pollution>
- Duplicate parameters in query/body to influence server-side precedence (id=123&id=456); try both orderings
- Mix case/alias param names so gateway and backend disagree (userId vs userid)
</parameter_pollution>

<cache_and_gateway>
- CDN/proxy key confusion: responses keyed without Authorization or tenant headers expose cached objects to other users; manipulate Vary and Accept
- Redirect chains and 304/206 behaviors can leak content across tenants
</cache_and_gateway>

<race_windows>
- Time-of-check vs time-of-use: change the referenced ID between validation and execution using parallel requests
</race_windows>
</bypass_techniques>

<special_contexts>
<websocket>
- Authorization per-subscription: ensure channel/topic names cannot be guessed (user_{id}, org_{id}); subscribe/publish checks must run server-side, not only at handshake
- Try sending messages with target user IDs after subscribing to own channels
</websocket>

<grpc>
- Direct protobuf fields (owner_id, tenant_id) often bypass HTTP-layer middleware; validate references via grpcurl with tokens from different principals
</grpc>

<integrations>
- Webhooks/callbacks referencing foreign objects (e.g., invoice_id) processed without verifying ownership
- Third-party importers syncing data into wrong tenant due to missing tenant binding
</integrations>
</special_contexts>

<chaining_attacks>
- IDOR + CSRF: force victims to trigger unauthorized changes on objects you discovered
- IDOR + Stored XSS: pivot into other users' sessions through data you gained access to
- IDOR + SSRF: exfiltrate internal IDs, then access their corresponding resources
- IDOR + Race: bypass spot checks with simultaneous requests
</chaining_attacks>

<validation>
1. Demonstrate access to an object not owned by the caller (content or metadata).
2. Show the same request fails with appropriately enforced authorization when corrected.
3. Prove cross-channel consistency: same unauthorized access via at least two transports (e.g., REST and GraphQL).
4. Document tenant boundary violations (if applicable).
5. Provide reproducible steps and evidence (requests/responses for owner vs non-owner).
</validation>

<false_positives>
- Public/anonymous resources by design
- Soft-privatized data where content is already public
- Idempotent metadata lookups that do not reveal sensitive content
- Correct row-level checks enforced across all channels
</false_positives>

<llm_reasoning_errors>
COMMON AI MISTAKES THAT CAUSE FALSE POSITIVES - AVOID THESE:

1. PUBLIC DATA CONFUSION:
   WRONG: "I accessed /api/users/123 and saw user data, proving IDOR"
   RIGHT: Some data is intentionally public (user profiles, public posts).
          IDOR requires accessing data that SHOULD be protected from you.
          Test: Can an UNAUTHENTICATED or DIFFERENTLY-AUTHORIZED user access the same data?
          Compare: Your own ID vs another user's ID vs anonymous access.

2. AUTHORIZATION WORKING CORRECTLY:
   WRONG: "Changing user_id from 1 to 2 returned different data"
   RIGHT: If you're an admin or have permission to view user 2, this is CORRECT behavior.
          IDOR requires accessing data you're NOT AUTHORIZED to see.
          Need: Two accounts where Account A cannot legitimately access Account B's data.

3. ENUMERATION WITHOUT ACCESS:
   WRONG: "I can increment IDs and see they exist (200 vs 404), proving IDOR"
   RIGHT: Knowing an ID EXISTS is different from ACCESSING its data.
          Object enumeration might be a minor info leak, not IDOR.
          IDOR requires retrieving or modifying the actual protected content.

4. SELF-REFERENTIAL ACCESS:
   WRONG: "I changed the user_id to my own and could access my data"
   RIGHT: Accessing your OWN data is not IDOR. You need to prove access to SOMEONE ELSE'S data.
          Test must use two distinct accounts with separate authorization scopes.

5. ADMIN/STAFF ACCESS CONFUSION:
   WRONG: "As admin, I can view any user's data - IDOR!"
   RIGHT: Admins are often SUPPOSED to access all data. This is authorization working correctly.
          IDOR: A REGULAR USER accessing another REGULAR USER's data.

6. DIFFERENT RESOURCE TYPES:
   WRONG: "I found /api/documents/1 exists, so all numbered resources have IDOR"
   RIGHT: Each endpoint has its own authorization. /documents/1 might be public while /invoices/1 is protected.
          Test each resource type independently.
</llm_reasoning_errors>

<expanded_false_positives>
FALSE POSITIVE SCENARIOS - DO NOT REPORT:

1. INTENTIONALLY PUBLIC DATA:
   - Public user profiles (username, avatar, bio)
   - Published content (blog posts, comments, public files)
   - Directory listings designed for discovery
   - Shared links with intentional access tokens

2. PROPER AUTHORIZATION IN PLACE:
   - 403 Forbidden when accessing another user's resource
   - Empty response or generic "not found" for unauthorized access
   - Redirect to login for unauthenticated attempts
   - Row-level security filtering returning only your own data

3. ROLE-APPROPRIATE ACCESS:
   - Admin accessing any user (admin privilege by design)
   - Support staff viewing customer data (support role by design)
   - Manager seeing team member data (hierarchical access by design)

4. SAME-USER BOUNDARY:
   - Accessing your own data via different ID formats (numeric vs UUID)
   - Reading your own linked resources (your orders, your files)

5. EXISTENCE LEAKAGE ONLY:
   - Can tell ID exists (200) vs doesn't exist (404) but cannot read content
   - Timing differences without content access
   - Error messages revealing ID validity but not data
</expanded_false_positives>

<impact>
- Cross-account data exposure (PII/PHI/PCI)
- Unauthorized state changes (transfers, role changes, cancellations)
- Cross-tenant data leaks violating contractual and regulatory boundaries
- Regulatory risk (GDPR/HIPAA/PCI), fraud, reputational damage
</impact>

<pro_tips>
1. Always test list/search/export endpoints first; they are rich ID seeders.
2. Build a reusable ID corpus from logs, notifications, emails, and client bundles.
3. Toggle content-types and transports; authorization middleware often differs per stack.
4. In GraphQL, validate at resolver boundaries; never trust parent auth to cover children.
5. In multi-tenant apps, vary org headers, subdomains, and path params independently.
6. Check batch/bulk operations and background job endpoints; they frequently skip per-item checks.
7. Inspect gateways for header trust and cache key configuration.
8. Treat UUIDs as untrusted; obtain them via OSINT/leaks and test binding.
9. Use timing/size/ETag differentials for blind confirmation when content is masked.
10. Prove impact with precise before/after diffs and role-separated evidence.
</pro_tips>

<remember>Authorization must bind subject, action, and specific object on every request, regardless of identifier opacity or transport. If the binding is missing anywhere, the system is vulnerable.</remember>
