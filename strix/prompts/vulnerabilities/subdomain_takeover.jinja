<title>SUBDOMAIN TAKEOVER</title>

<critical>Subdomain takeover lets an attacker serve content from a trusted subdomain by claiming resources referenced by dangling DNS (CNAME/A/ALIAS/NS) or mis-bound provider configurations. Consequences include phishing on a trusted origin, cookie and CORS pivot, OAuth redirect abuse, and CDN cache poisoning.</critical>

<scope>
- Dangling CNAME/A/ALIAS to third-party services (hosting, storage, serverless, CDN)
- Orphaned NS delegations (child zones with abandoned/expired nameservers)
- Decommissioned SaaS integrations (support, docs, marketing, forms) referenced via CNAME
- CDN “alternate domain” mappings (CloudFront/Fastly/Azure CDN) lacking ownership verification
- Storage and static hosting endpoints (S3/Blob/GCS buckets, GitHub/GitLab Pages)
</scope>

<methodology>
1. Enumerate subdomains comprehensively (web, API, mobile, legacy): aggregate CT logs, passive DNS, and org inventory. De-duplicate and normalize.
2. Resolve DNS for all RR types: A/AAAA, CNAME, NS, MX, TXT. Keep CNAME chains; record terminal CNAME targets and provider hints.
3. HTTP/TLS probe: capture status, body, length, canonical error text, Server/alt-svc headers, certificate SANs, and CDN headers (Via, X-Served-By).
4. Fingerprint providers: map known “unclaimed/missing resource” signatures to candidate services. Maintain a living dictionary.
5. Attempt claim (only with authorization): create the missing resource on the provider with the exact required name; bind the custom domain if the provider allows.
6. Validate control: serve a minimal unique payload; confirm over HTTPS; optionally obtain a DV certificate (CT log evidence) within legal scope.
</methodology>

<discovery_techniques>
<enumeration_pipeline>
- Subdomain inventory: combine CT (crt.sh APIs), passive DNS sources, in-house asset lists, IaC/terraform outputs, mobile app assets, and historical DNS
- Resolver sweep: use IPv4/IPv6-aware resolvers; track NXDOMAIN vs SERVFAIL vs provider-branded 4xx/5xx responses
- Record graph: build a CNAME graph and collapse chains to identify external endpoints (e.g., myapp.example.com → foo.azurewebsites.net)
</enumeration_pipeline>

<dns_indicators>
- CNAME targets ending in provider domains: github.io, amazonaws.com, cloudfront.net, azurewebsites.net, blob.core.windows.net, fastly.net, vercel.app, netlify.app, herokudns.com, trafficmanager.net, azureedge.net, akamaized.net
- Orphaned NS: subzone delegated to nameservers on a domain that has expired or no longer hosts authoritative servers; or to inexistent NS hosts
- MX to third-party mail providers with decommissioned domains (risk: mail subdomain control or delivery manipulation)
- TXT/verification artifacts (asuid, _dnsauth, _github-pages-challenge) suggesting previous external bindings
</dns_indicators>

<http_fingerprints>
- Service-specific unclaimed messages (examples, not exhaustive):
  - GitHub Pages: “There isn’t a GitHub Pages site here.”
  - Fastly: “Fastly error: unknown domain”
  - Heroku: “No such app” or “There’s nothing here, yet.”
  - S3 static site: “NoSuchBucket” / “The specified bucket does not exist”
  - CloudFront (alt domain not configured): 403/400 with “The request could not be satisfied” and no matching distribution
  - Azure App Service: default 404 for azurewebsites.net unless custom-domain verified (look for asuid TXT requirement)
  - Shopify: “Sorry, this shop is currently unavailable”
- TLS clues: certificate CN/SAN referencing provider default host instead of the custom subdomain indicates potential mis-binding
</http_fingerprints>
</discovery_techniques>

<exploitation_techniques>
<claim_third_party_resource>
- Create the resource with the exact required name:
  - Storage/hosting: S3 bucket “sub.example.com” (website endpoint) or bucket named after the CNAME target if provider dictates
  - Pages hosting: create repo/site and add the custom domain (when provider does not enforce prior domain verification)
  - Serverless/app hosting: create app/site matching the target hostname, then add custom domain mapping
- Bind the custom domain: some providers require TXT verification (modern hardened path), others historically allowed binding without proof
</claim_third_party_resource>

<cdn_alternate_domains>
- Add the victim subdomain as an alternate domain on your CDN distribution if the provider does not enforce domain ownership checks
- Upload a TLS cert via provider or use managed cert issuance if allowed; confirm 200 on the subdomain with your content
</cdn_alternate_domains>

<ns_delegation_takeover>
- If a child zone (e.g., zone.example.com) is delegated to nameservers under an expired domain (ns1.abandoned.tld), register abandoned.tld and host authoritative NS; publish records to control all hosts under the delegated subzone
- Validate with SOA/NS queries and serve a verification token; then add A/CNAME/MX/TXT as needed
</ns_delegation_takeover>

<mail_surface>
- If MX points to a decommissioned provider that allowed inbox creation without domain re-verification (historically), a takeover could enable email receipt for that subdomain; modern providers generally require explicit TXT ownership
</mail_surface>
</exploitation_techniques>

<advanced_techniques>
<blind_and_cache_channels>
- CDN edge behavior: 404/421 vs 403 differentials reveal whether an alt name is partially configured; probe with Host header manipulation
- Cache poisoning: once taken over, exploit cache keys and Vary headers to persist malicious responses at the edge
</blind_and_cache_channels>

<ct_and_tls>
- Use CT logs to detect unexpected certificate issuance for your subdomain; for PoC, issue a DV cert post-takeover (within scope) to produce verifiable evidence
</ct_and_tls>

<oauth_and_trust_chains>
- If the subdomain is whitelisted as an OAuth redirect/callback or in CSP/script-src, a takeover elevates impact to account takeover or script injection on trusted origins
</oauth_and_trust_chains>

<provider_edges>
- Many providers hardened domain binding (TXT verification) but legacy projects or specific products remain weak; verify per-product behavior (CDN vs app hosting vs storage)
- Multi-tenant providers sometimes accept custom domains at the edge even when backend resource is missing; leverage timing and registration windows
</provider_edges>
</advanced_techniques>

<bypass_techniques>
<verification_gaps>
- Look for providers that accept domain binding prior to TXT verification, or where verification is optional for trial/legacy tiers
- Race windows: re-claim resource names immediately after victim deletion while DNS still points to provider
</verification_gaps>

<wildcards_and_fallbacks>
- Wildcard CNAMEs to providers may expose unbounded subdomains; test random hosts to identify service-wide unclaimed behavior
- Fallback origins: CDNs configured with multiple origins may expose unknown-domain responses from a default origin that is claimable
</wildcards_and_fallbacks>
</bypass_techniques>

<special_contexts>
<storage_and_static>
- S3/GCS/Azure Blob static sites: bucket naming constraints dictate whether a bucket can match hostname; website vs API endpoints differ in claimability and fingerprints
</storage_and_static>

<serverless_and_hosting>
- GitHub/GitLab Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Azure Static Web Apps: domain binding flows vary; most require TXT now, but historical projects or specific paths may not
</serverless_and_hosting>

<cdn_and_edge>
- CloudFront/Fastly/Azure CDN/Akamai: alternate domain verification differs; some products historically allowed alt-domain claims without proof
</cdn_and_edge>

<dns_delegations>
- Child-zone NS delegations outrank parent records; control of delegated NS yields full control of all hosts below that label
</dns_delegations>
</special_contexts>

<validation>
1. Before: record DNS chain, HTTP response (status/body length/fingerprint), and TLS details.
2. After claim: serve unique content and verify over HTTPS at the target subdomain.
3. Optional: issue a DV certificate (legal scope) and reference CT entry as durable evidence.
4. Demonstrate impact chains (CSP/script-src trust, OAuth redirect acceptance, cookie Domain scoping) with minimal PoCs.
</validation>

<false_positives>
- "Unknown domain" pages that are not claimable due to enforced TXT/ownership checks.
- Provider-branded default pages for valid, owned resources (not a takeover) versus "unclaimed resource" states
- Soft 404s from your own infrastructure or catch-all vhosts
</false_positives>

<llm_reasoning_errors>
COMMON AI MISTAKES THAT CAUSE FALSE POSITIVES - AVOID THESE:

1. CNAME TO PROVIDER != TAKEOVER:
   WRONG: "Subdomain has CNAME to amazonaws.com, subdomain takeover possible"
   RIGHT: CNAME to a provider is normal cloud infrastructure.
          Takeover requires: (1) resource NOT claimed, (2) you CAN claim it.
          Most AWS/Azure/GCP resources are properly configured and owned.
          You must prove the resource is claimable, not just that CNAME exists.

2. ERROR PAGE MISINTERPRETATION:
   WRONG: "Subdomain returns 404, proving it's vulnerable"
   RIGHT: 404 errors have many causes: misconfiguration, maintenance, intentional.
          Subdomain takeover requires specific "unclaimed resource" signatures.
          Generic 404s from working infrastructure are not takeovers.

3. DNS EXISTS != EXPLOITABLE:
   WRONG: "DNS record points to external service, takeover vulnerability"
   RIGHT: DNS records pointing to services is how the internet works.
          You must verify: (1) the target resource doesn't exist, AND
          (2) you can actually claim/create that resource on the provider.
          Many providers now require ownership verification.

4. PROVIDER FINGERPRINT WITHOUT CLAIM TEST:
   WRONG: "Response matches GitHub Pages 'no site here' fingerprint"
   RIGHT: Matching a fingerprint is step 1 of verification, not final proof.
          Modern GitHub Pages requires verification via DNS TXT record.
          You must actually attempt to claim the resource to confirm vulnerability.

5. INTERNAL/PRIVATE SUBDOMAIN:
   WRONG: "Internal subdomain sub.corp.example.com has dangling CNAME"
   RIGHT: If subdomain is not publicly accessible or resolvable externally,
          the impact is limited. Focus on public-facing subdomains.
          Internal-only misconfigurations may not be security issues.

6. PROVIDER HARDENING NOT CONSIDERED:
   WRONG: "This worked in 2019, so it still works"
   RIGHT: Many providers (GitHub, AWS, Azure) have added domain verification.
          Test with CURRENT provider behavior, not historical knowledge.
          If provider now requires TXT verification, takeover may be blocked.
</llm_reasoning_errors>

<expanded_false_positives>
FALSE POSITIVE SCENARIOS - DO NOT REPORT:

1. PROPERLY OWNED RESOURCES:
   - CNAME to active S3 bucket owned by the organization
   - Azure App Service with verified custom domain
   - CloudFront distribution properly configured for the domain
   - GitHub Pages with verified DNS ownership

2. PROVIDER VERIFICATION BLOCKS TAKEOVER:
   - TXT record required before custom domain binding
   - Domain verification email/DNS required
   - Provider account linking required
   - SSL certificate verification required

3. WORKING BUT MISCONFIGURED SERVICES:
   - 404 from working web server (not unclaimed resource)
   - SSL errors from misconfigured but owned certificate
   - Timeouts from overloaded but active service
   - Maintenance pages from owned infrastructure

4. NON-ACTIONABLE DNS:
   - CNAME to internal/private service
   - CNAME to service requiring paid account you can't create
   - Delegated NS to nameservers you cannot register
   - MX to mail service with domain verification

5. LIMITED SCOPE ISSUES:
   - Subdomain only accessible from internal network
   - Legacy subdomain with no traffic/users
   - Test/dev subdomains clearly marked as non-production
</expanded_false_positives>

<impact>
- Content injection under trusted subdomain: phishing, malware delivery, brand damage
- Cookie and CORS pivot: if parent site sets Domain-scoped cookies or allows subdomain origins in CORS/Trusted Types/CSP
- OAuth/SSO abuse via whitelisted redirect URIs
- Email delivery manipulation for subdomain (MX/DMARC/SPF interactions in edge cases)
</impact>

<pro_tips>
1. Build a pipeline: enumerate (subfinder/amass) → resolve (dnsx) → probe (httpx) → fingerprint (nuclei/custom) → verify claims.
2. Maintain a current fingerprint corpus; provider messages change frequently—prefer regex families over exact strings.
3. Prefer minimal PoCs: static “ownership proof” page and, where allowed, DV cert issuance for auditability.
4. Monitor CT for unexpected certs on your subdomains; alert and investigate.
5. Eliminate dangling DNS in decommission workflows first; deletion of the app/service must remove or block the DNS target.
6. For NS delegations, treat any expired nameserver domain as critical; reassign or remove delegation immediately.
7. Use CAA to limit certificate issuance while you triage; it reduces the blast radius for taken-over hosts.
</pro_tips>

<remember>Subdomain safety is lifecycle safety: if DNS points at anything, you must own and verify the thing on every provider and product path. Remove or verify—there is no safe middle.</remember>
