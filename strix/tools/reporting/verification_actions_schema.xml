  <tool name="verify_vulnerability_report">
    <description>Submit verification decision for a pending vulnerability report.

Use this tool ONLY after attempting to reproduce the vulnerability.
This is the ONLY way to finalize or reject a pending vulnerability report.

BEFORE CALLING:
- You MUST have attempted to reproduce the vulnerability
- You MUST have documented your reproduction attempts
- You MUST have compared results to the original evidence

VERIFIED CRITERIA (verified=True):
- Reproduced the exact same behavior as reported
- Consistent results across 3+ attempts
- Demonstrated actual security impact
- Negative control confirmed authorization exists

REJECTED CRITERIA (verified=False):
- Cannot reproduce despite following all steps
- Reported behavior is normal functionality
- No actual security impact demonstrated
- Finding requires already having access</description>
